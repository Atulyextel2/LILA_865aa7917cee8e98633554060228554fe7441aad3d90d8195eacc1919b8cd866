Unity Data Optimisation &amp; Weapon System Demo  A Unity demo project built to practice data optimisation for multiplayer position sync (Task 1) and a class-only weapon system with HUD integration (Task 2). The project applies OOP principles, SOLID design, and design patterns to keep code modular, testable, and extensible.
üîπ Task 1: Position Sync & Data Optimisation
	‚Ä¢	Absolute + Delta Compression
	‚Ä¢	First snapshot = ABS (32-bit ints, supports any start position).
	‚Ä¢	Subsequent updates = DELTA (16-bit ints, just 9 bytes).
	‚Ä¢	Automatic ABS fallback if deltas overflow ‚Üí prevents drift/clamping.
	‚Ä¢	Snapshot Interpolator (time-buffered)
	‚Ä¢	Remote movement is smoothed by sampling now ‚àí delay.
	‚Ä¢	Seeding on first ABS ‚Üí no visible lag at start.
	‚Ä¢	Unity Integration
	‚Ä¢	Pure C# domain (quantiser, codec, interpolator).
	‚Ä¢	Thin Unity behaviours for sending/receiving + HUD binding.
	‚Ä¢	Simple WASD local movement ‚Üí compressed ‚Üí loopback ‚Üí remote replay.
	‚Ä¢	HUD Debugging
	‚Ä¢	On-screen stats for sent bytes & received positions.
	‚Ä¢	Console logs distinguish ABS vs DELTA.

üîπ Task 2: Weapon System & HUD
	‚Ä¢	Domain-only weapon system (no MonoBehaviours in core logic):
	‚Ä¢	WeaponBase, Rifle, Pistol, PlayerCombat, WeaponLoadout.
	‚Ä¢	Handles ammo, fire rate, reload times, weapon switching.
	‚Ä¢	Event-driven architecture
	‚Ä¢	WeaponBus events for fire/reload.
	‚Ä¢	Easy to hook up to any UI or gameplay system.
	‚Ä¢	HUD Presenter (MVP pattern)
	‚Ä¢	WeaponHudPresenter builds a HUD view-model from domain state.
	‚Ä¢	UnityWeaponHudView renders it into uGUI Texts.
	‚Ä¢	Shows:
	‚Ä¢	Current active weapon.
	‚Ä¢	Current ammo (mag).
	‚Ä¢	Total ammo (mag + reserve).
	‚Ä¢	Which slot is equipped (P1, P2, S).
	‚Ä¢	Clean separation
	‚Ä¢	Core logic is pure C#, independent of Unity.
	‚Ä¢	Thin MonoBehaviours only for demo scene hosting.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Unity 2022.3 LTS
	‚Ä¢	C# (OOP, SOLID, events, dependency inversion)
	‚Ä¢	Custom bit-packed networking
	‚Ä¢	Unity UI (uGUI) for HUDs

‚∏ª

üöÄ How to Run
	1.	Clone the repo.
	2.	Open in Unity 2022.3 LTS.
	3.	Open Task_1 and Task_2 scenes.

Controls

Task 1 (Networking demo)
	‚Ä¢	WASD ‚Üí move LocalPlayer capsule.
	‚Ä¢	RemotePlayer capsule follows using compressed network snapshots.
	‚Ä¢	HUD shows Sent/Received data; Console logs show ABS/DELTA packets.

Task 2 (Weapons demo)
	‚Ä¢	F ‚Üí fire active weapon.
	‚Ä¢	R ‚Üí reload.
	‚Ä¢	1 / 2 / 3 ‚Üí switch between P1 / P2 / S slots.
	‚Ä¢	HUD updates active weapon, current & total ammo.
